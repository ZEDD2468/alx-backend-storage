NoSQL represents a departure from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) and introduces a more flexible approach to handling data. SQL, a query language utilized by RDBMS, organizes data into tables, columns, and rows according to predefined schemas. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these rigid structures and instead embrace versatile data models. The term "NoSQL" can be interpreted as either "not SQL" or "not only SQL."

As data-intensive applications with demanding performance, scalability, and flexibility requirements emerged, RDBMS began to show limitations. In response, mainstream enterprises turned to NoSQL databases to meet these modern challenges. NoSQL proves particularly beneficial for storing unstructured data, which is growing at a faster rate than structured data and doesn't align with the relational schemas of RDBMS. Examples of unstructured data include user and session data, chat and messaging records, log data, time series data like IoT and device information, as well as large objects such as videos and images.
